abstract = {4.2.2 EMAP Module – Processor Communication The MSP’s dual USART controllers may be configured to support I2C, SPI, or UART serial protocols. I2C is chosen for inter-board communications since it provides a multi-master capability with implicit bus arbitration. This permits convenient expansion of the LEAP platform to include multiple EMAP modules and multiple high-performance processors. The LEAP system is implemented with the SPM and EMAP processors operating as I2C peers. Either device may initiate transactions with the other or with any other device. The second MSP USART controller is configured as an SPI master for access to the CC2420 radio. An MMCX external antenna connector is included.},

abstract = {The paper describes a system which integrates the virtual reality technology with the robotics for education purposes. Robotics is an important area in science and technology. The virtual reality technology allows users to interact efficiently with 3D computerized environments in real time using their natural senses and skills. VR is a suitable tool for developing a robotics education system due to its inherent simulation and modeling capabilities. In the system, three virtual robots were modeled with 3ds max. The kinematics simulation including forward kinematics and inverse kinematics was implemented on all three virtual robots. Collision detection was calculated in the kinematics simulation. The developed program is intended to provide an authentic context and generate high levels of motivation. Since robots are expensive and often beyond the resource of many universities, well design virtual robots with useful instructions of operation can overcome this challenging problem. At the same time, students gain a realistic experience in simulation and modeling with this program.},
