I would like to offer my sincere thanks to my supervisor Pr. Daniel Coore, who has provided me with endless guidance and support.  He has been an inspiration in my field and has provided me with insight and vast knowledge to help in the successful completion of this thesis.


Thanks to the Department of Computing, for providing me with the opportunity to further my studies and financial support through the Departmental Award.  

To the members of my research group, I owe many thanks for the drive and motivation in completing my studies.  The weekly meetings are an essential part of providing the momentum to complete.

Finally, this project could not have been complete without the strength and knowledge endowed upon me by God.
