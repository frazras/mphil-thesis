We present the architecture and deign of a general purpose robotics development kit, called X10ABOT, which aims to facilitate the rapid development of robotic solutions to a wide variety of problems. Robotics kits of this sort are usually aimed at casual hobbyists and children, and as a result, they usually have severe limitations in the number of sensors and actuators that they can manage. In contrast, X10ABOT is: modular (new functionality is added through standard daughter board modules), scalable (up to 16 sensors and actuators on each of up to 112 daughter board modules), and extensible (module software can be upgraded to support new types of sensors and actuators). We have also designed a generic port, capable of handling several types of sensors; and we have done similarly for the actuators. 
We demonstrate the application of the platform to the development of a general purpose robotics kit that will show how the system would allow its users to readily add extra sensors and actuators to a project, with minimal configuration, and relatively little impact on the pre-existing user code.
